# Raspberry Pi Infrared Message Protocol

This project is trying to use a IR sensor and an IR LED to send and receive
encoded messages via infrared light.

You should be able to have one raspberry pi on one side of a room and be able to
send messages across the room! It is fun to block the messages by obstructing them
or sending a bunch of interference via a different IR remote.

The end goal of this is to have a ready to go activity you can play with kids or
adults as an introduction to some computer science basics. You can also dive 
deeper for more savvy individuals like trying to implement error correction into
your message protocol.


## Parts necessary:
 - Any [Raspberry Pi micro computer](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/) (more recent are preferable)
 - [Micro SD card](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2820)
 - [Raspberry Pi power supply](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4298)
 - [IR sensor](https://www.adafruit.com/product/157)
 - [IR LED](https://www.adafruit.com/product/387)
 - [Breadboard](https://www.adafruit.com/product/64)
 - [Male to Female jumper wires](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1954)

You may be able to find these parts on amazon for cheaper as well.


## TODOs:
 - Finish the basic code
 - Step by step guild
 - create partially complete code with steps for completion
 - Create next steps or other things to try
